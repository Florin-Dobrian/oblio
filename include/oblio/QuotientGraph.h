// QuotientGraph.h - the representation Oblio's own minimum-degree orderings run on, and the
// degree buckets they pick from. Shared by Mmd1 and Amd1, which differ only in their drivers:
// one batches eliminations to make the degree refresh rare, the other bounds the degree to make
// each refresh cheap. Everything below that fork is here.
//
// The idea, in one line: an elimination does not create fill edges, it creates a CLIQUE, and a
// clique of d vertices is a d-element list rather than d(d-1)/2 edges. So the neighbor relation
// splits in two, and the true neighborhood is their union, formed on demand and never stored:
//
//     A[u]     the vertices u is still explicitly adjacent to
//     I[u]     the cliques that contain u
//     C[c]     the members of clique c
//
//     reach(u) = ( A[u] | C[c] for c in I[u] ) - {u}
//
// This is George and Liu's reachable set, and it equals the neighborhood the filled graph would
// have. Section 5.3 of archive/sparse_factorization.md carries the derivation; the literature
// says "element" where we say "clique" and writes E_i for I[u].
//
// A[u] and I[u] are the two kinds of SOURCE the union is taken over, and their number falls
// monotonically: an elimination turns a source of the first kind into one of the second and never
// manufactures one. So the two lists share one block, sized once from u's column of A and never
// grown, which is what both vendored routines do and what section 5.3 of
// archive/sparse_factorization.md proves they may. C[c] has no such bound and gets an arena.
//
// A clique id is the pivot that created it, so cliques index into the vertex space and no
// separate id space is needed. A dead clique is an empty member list: absorption clears the
// members, and an empty clique contributes nothing to any reachable set or count, so no
// liveness flag is carried.
//
// No sets anywhere. Membership is a mark array stamped with a monotone tag, so a query is one
// comparison and nothing is allocated, which is what SymFactorEngine does with its index sets
// and what the vendored routines do with marker/tag. Every list edit is a compaction in place.
//
// The prototypes these were pulled from are experiments/ordering/mmd1 and amd1, where the same
// structures carry the tracing and counting that a production ordering has no use for.
