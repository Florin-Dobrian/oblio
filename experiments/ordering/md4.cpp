// md4.cpp -- minimum degree, iteration 4: maintained degrees.
//
// Every version so far has recomputed a reachable set for EVERY live vertex at
// EVERY iteration, just to find the smallest, then thrown all but one away. On a 3D
// grid that is roughly ten times the necessary work, and the ratio grows with n.
// Section 5.7 of archive/sparse_factorization.md.
//
// The waste is easy to see once stated: eliminating a pivot can only change the
// degrees of the vertices it REACHED. Every other vertex has the same A, the same
// cliques and the same live neighbors as before, so its degree is still whatever
// it was.
//
// So we keep a degrees[] array and refresh only the reached set. The picker then
// scans cached integers instead of building set unions. This is the first half of
// what both MMD and AMD do before their ideas diverge; md5 adds the second half,
// degree buckets, which removes the scan itself.
//
// Why refreshing the clique alone is enough, in three parts:
//
//   - PRUNING and clique membership change only for members of the new clique
//   - ABSORPTION deletes cliques the pivot belonged to, and every member of such
//     a clique is reachable from the pivot, hence in the new clique
//   - MERGING removes a vertex u, but u merged only because everything it could
//     see lay inside the new clique, so nobody outside sees u disappear
//
// Nothing else in the graph can tell that an elimination happened.
//
// Build:  g++ -std=c++17 -O3 md4.cpp -o md4_cpp  (or: make)
// Run:    ./md4_cpp
//         ./md4_cpp 3      just the third example
